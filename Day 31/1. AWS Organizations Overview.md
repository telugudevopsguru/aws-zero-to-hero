### ✅ AWS Organizations – Complete Overview

- **AWS Organizations** is a service that helps you centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts.
- It allows for consolidated billing, service control policies (SCPs), and account management, all under one umbrella called an "organization".


### 🔹 Key Concepts

| **Term**                            | **Description**                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Organization**                    | A collection of AWS accounts centrally managed via AWS Organizations.                                                       |
| **Management Account**              | The first account created in the organization, formerly called the master account. It can create and manage other accounts. |
| **Member Account**                  | An AWS account invited or created in the organization.                                                                      |
| **Organizational Unit (OU)**        | A logical grouping of accounts used to apply policies easily. OUs can be nested.                                            |
| **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** | Policies to control what services and actions accounts/OUs can use.                                                         |
| **Consolidated Billing**            | Central billing for all accounts under an organization. Provides volume discounts.                                          |


### 🔸 Benefits

* **Centralized Management**: Manage multiple accounts from a single dashboard.
* **Security & Compliance**: Use SCPs to enforce compliance across accounts.
* **Separation of Workloads**: Isolate environments (prod, dev, test) or departments.
* **Billing Optimization**: Combine usage for cost-saving through consolidated billing.


### 🔸 Structure Example

```
Organization: TECHWORLDWITHMURALI
│
└── OU: Environments
     ├── Account: dev         # Development
     ├── Account: test        # TEST
     ├── Account: uat         # UAT
     ├── Account: prod        # Production – customer-facing workloads
     ├── Account: management        # Production – customer-facing workloads
     └── Account: security    # Centralized logs, monitoring, audit (CloudTrail, GuardDuty)


```

### 🔹 Service Control Policies (SCPs)

* Applied at OU or account level.
* Don’t grant permissions, only restrict.
* Work with IAM – SCPs filter the maximum permissions IAM can grant.

📝 **Example SCP**: Deny use of specific services (e.g., deny S3 in "dev" OU).


### 🔹 Use Cases

* Centralize billing for multiple teams.
* Create isolated environments for security (e.g., security audit account).
* Prevent use of risky services via SCPs (e.g., block EC2 in R\&D accounts).
* Automate account creation for new departments or projects.


### 🔸 Common Commands (AWS CLI)

```bash
# Create an Organization
aws organizations create-organization --feature-set ALL

# Create a new account
aws organizations create-account --email "team@example.com" --account-name "TeamAccount"

# Create an OU
aws organizations create-organizational-unit --parent-id <root-id> --name "Dev"

# Attach SCP
aws organizations attach-policy --policy-id <scp-id> --target-id <account-id or ou-id>
```
