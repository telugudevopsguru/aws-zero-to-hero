### What is AWS Directory Service?

- AWS Directory Service is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to set up and run directories in the AWS Cloud.
- It offers multiple directory options, including AWS Managed Microsoft AD, Simple AD, and AD Connector, to integrate with your on-premises directories and to manage your AWS resources more efficiently.

### AWS Directory Service Options

1. **AWS Managed Microsoft AD:**
   - A fully managed Active Directory (AD) service that provides the same features and capabilities as an on-premises Microsoft AD.
   - Supports AWS applications and services that require AD.
   - Allows you to extend your on-premises AD to the AWS Cloud.

2. **Simple AD:**
   - A cost-effective, standalone directory powered by Samba 4.
   - Suitable for small to medium-sized businesses that need basic AD features.

3. **AD Connector:**
   - A directory gateway that connects your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory to AWS.
   - Allows you to proxy authentication requests to your on-premises AD without caching any information in the cloud.
