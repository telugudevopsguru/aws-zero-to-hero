### What is AWS EBS?

- Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances.
- It provides persistent block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances.
- EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be used for databases, file systems, or any other application requiring durable storage.

### Key Features of AWS EBS

- **Elasticity**: Volumes can be dynamically scaled in size and performance to meet changing application demands.
- **Durability**: Data is automatically replicated within an Availability Zone to protect against component failures.
- **Snapshotting**: Point-in-time snapshots enable backup and recovery of EBS volumes.
- **Encryption**: Volumes can be encrypted using AWS-managed or customer-managed keys for enhanced security.
- **Availability**: Available in all AWS regions, allowing attachment to instances within the same region.

### Lab Session - Creation of an EBS Volume

Creating an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume in AWS involves a few straightforward steps. Here’s a concise guide on how to create an EBS volume:

### Steps to Create an EBS Volume in AWS

1. **Navigate to the EC2 Console:**
   - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the EC2 dashboard.

2. **Access the Volumes Section:**
   - In the left-hand navigation pane, click on **"Volumes"** under the **"Elastic Block Store"** section.

3. **Create Volume:**
   - Click on **"Create Volume"** button.

4. **Configure Volume Settings:**
   - **Volume Type:** Choose the appropriate type based on your workload (e.g., gp2, io1, st1, sc1).
   - **Size (GiB):** Specify the size of the volume in gigabytes (GB).
   - **Availability Zone:** Select the availability zone where your EC2 instance that will use this volume is located.

5. **Configure Additional Settings (Optional):**
   - **Snapshot:** You can create a new volume from an existing snapshot if needed.
   - **Encryption:** Choose whether to encrypt the volume using AWS-managed keys or customer-managed keys.
   - **Tags:** Add tags to label your volume for easier management.

6. **Review and Create:**
   - Review your configuration settings.
   - Click **"Create Volume"** to create the EBS volume.

### Example:

Let's say you want to create a 50 GiB General Purpose SSD (gp2) volume in the us-east-1a availability zone without encryption:

- **Volume Type:** General Purpose SSD (gp2)
- **Size:** 50 GiB
- **Availability Zone:** us-east-1a
- **Encryption:** None (optional)

After reviewing your settings, click **"Create Volume"**. The EBS volume will be created and will appear in the list of volumes in the EC2 console. You can then attach this volume to your EC2 instance as needed.


### Lab Session - Attach an EBS Volume to a Linux EC2 Instance

Attaching an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume to a Linux EC2 instance in AWS involves a few steps. Here’s a guide on how to attach an EBS volume to a Linux EC2 instance:

### Steps to Attach an EBS Volume to a Linux EC2 Instance

1. **Navigate to the EC2 Console:**
   - Log in to your AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the EC2 dashboard.

2. **Identify Your EC2 Instance:**
   - Note the Instance ID of the Linux EC2 instance to which you want to attach the EBS volume.

3. **Create an EBS Volume (if not already created):**
   - Follow the steps mentioned earlier to create an EBS volume, specifying the size, type, and availability zone.

4. **Attach the EBS Volume:**

   - In the EC2 dashboard, click on **"Volumes"** under **"Elastic Block Store"** in the left-hand navigation pane.
   - Select the EBS volume you want to attach by clicking its checkbox.

5. **Attach Volume Action:**
   - Click **"Actions"** and then **"Attach Volume"**.

6. **Configure Attachment:**
   - In the **"Instance"** field, start typing the instance ID or name of your Linux EC2 instance.
   - Select the instance from the drop-down list.
   - In the **"Device"** field, specify the device name on the instance (e.g., `/dev/xvdf`). This is the device path where the volume will be mounted in the instance.

7. **Attach the Volume:**
   - Click **"Attach"** to attach the EBS volume to your Linux EC2 instance.

### Example:

Let's say you have an existing Linux EC2 instance with Instance ID `i-0abcdef1234567890` and you want to attach a 100 GiB General Purpose SSD (gp3) volume (`vol-1234567890abcdef0`) to it as `/dev/sdf`:

- **Instance ID:** `i-0abcdef1234567890`
- **EBS Volume ID:** `vol-1234567890abcdef0`
- **Device:** `/dev/sdf`

After attaching the volume, you can log in to your Linux EC2 instance and proceed to mount the attached volume to make use of it.

### Mounting the EBS Volume on Linux

Here are the condensed steps to format and mount an attached EBS volume on a Linux EC2 instance:

1. **Connect to your instance:**
   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
   ```

2. **Identify the new volume:**
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```

3. **Check for existing filesystem:**
   ```bash
   sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
   ```

4. **Format the Volume (if not formatted):**

- If the volume has no filesystem, create one:
     ```bash
     sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
     ```
   - If `mkfs.xfs` is not found, install XFS tools:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install xfsprogs
     ```

   **Warning:** Do not format if the volume already has data (e.g., from a snapshot).


5. **Create a mount point:**
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /data
   ```

6. **Mount the volume:**
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
   ```

7. **Persist mount across reboots:**
   - Find the UUID of the device:
     ```bash
     sudo blkid
     ```
   - Edit `/etc/fstab`:
     ```bash
     sudo vim /etc/fstab
     ```
   - Add entry:
     ```plaintext
     UUID=your-uuid /data xfs defaults,nofail 0 2
     ```

8. **Verify the `/etc/fstab` entry:**
   ```bash
   sudo umount /data
   sudo mount -a
   ```

### Lab Session - Increase the Size of an Existing EBS Volume on a Linux EC2 Instance
Increasing the size of an existing EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume on a Linux EC2 instance in AWS involves several steps, including resizing the volume and extending the file system. Here's a detailed guide on how to accomplish this:

### Steps to Increase the Size of an Existing EBS Volume on a Linux EC2 Instance

### Example:

Suppose you have a Linux EC2 instance with an existing EBS volume (`vol-0abcdef1234567890`) of 50 GiB (`/dev/xvdf`) that you want to increase to 100 GiB:

1. **Modify Volume:**
   - Increase the size of `vol-0abcdef1234567890` to 100 GiB in the AWS Management Console.

2. **SSH into Your Linux Instance:**
   - Connect to your Linux instance via SSH.

3. **Resize the File System:**
   - Assuming it's an ext4 file system, use `sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdf`.

4. **Verify:**
   - Check with `df -h` to confirm the file system now shows the increased space.
