### What is AWS KMS?

**AWS Key Management Service (KMS):** A managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. It integrates with other AWS services to help you protect your data.

### Features and Benefits of AWS KMS

1. **Centralized Key Management:** Create, rotate, and manage encryption keys used across AWS services and your applications.
2. **Integration with AWS Services:** Seamlessly integrates with services like S3, EBS, RDS, and more for encryption at rest.
3. **Secure:** Uses hardware security modules (HSMs) to protect the security and integrity of your keys.
4. **Auditable:** Logs API calls made to KMS keys, providing visibility and compliance.
5. **Cost-Effective:** Pay only for what you use, with no upfront costs.

### Different Types of Keys in AWS KMS

1. **Customer Master Keys (CMKs):** Used to encrypt and decrypt data. Can be either symmetric or asymmetric.
   - **Symmetric CMKs:** Used for encrypting and decrypting data.
   - **Asymmetric CMKs:** Used for signing and verifying data.

2. **AWS Managed Keys:** KMS-managed keys that AWS creates, owns, and manages on your behalf for specific AWS services (e.g., S3, EBS).

### What is AWS SNS?

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service provided by AWS that enables the decoupling of microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. 

### Key Features
1. **Message Delivery**: SNS can deliver messages to a variety of endpoints, including email, SMS, HTTP/HTTPS endpoints, and AWS Lambda functions.
2. **Topic-Based**: Messages are published to topics, which are logical access points and communication channels.
3. **Scalability**: SNS can handle large volumes of messages and scale automatically to accommodate varying loads.
4. **Reliability**: It ensures high availability and durability of messages with multiple copies stored redundantly across multiple Availability Zones.
5. **Security**: Supports encryption at rest, and in-transit, and integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control.

### Components
1. **Topics**: 
   - Central communication channels where messages are sent and subscribers receive them.
2. **Subscriptions**: 
   - Endpoints (e.g., email, SMS, HTTP/HTTPS, AWS Lambda) that receive messages published to topics.
3. **Publishers**: 
   - Entities that send messages to SNS topics.
4. **Subscribers**: 
   - Entities that receive messages from SNS topics based on their subscriptions.

### Use Cases
1. **Application Integration**: Decouple components of an application to improve modularity and scalability.
2. **Mobile Notifications**: Send push notifications to mobile devices.
3. **Email and SMS Alerts**: Send alerts and notifications via email or SMS to users or administrators.
4. **Event-Driven Computing**: Trigger AWS Lambda functions or other services in response to events.
----
### Lab Session - Creating AWS SNS

2. **Create a Topic:**
   - Click on "Create topic."
   - Enter a topic name and optionally configure other settings.
   - Click "Create topic."

3. **Subscribe Endpoints:**
   - Subscribe endpoints (e.g., email addresses, HTTP endpoints, Lambda functions) to the topic to receive notifications.

### What is AWS SES?

Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective email service provided by AWS designed for businesses and developers to send and receive email. 

### Key Features
1. **Transactional Email**: Send transactional emails such as order confirmations, password resets, and other time-sensitive messages.
2. **Bulk Email**: Send marketing and promotional emails to large numbers of recipients.
3. **High Deliverability**: SES ensures high deliverability by leveraging its global infrastructure and various email best practices.
4. **Email Receiving**: Receive emails directly within your AWS environment, which can be stored in Amazon S3, trigger AWS Lambda functions, or publish to Amazon SNS.
