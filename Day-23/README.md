### What is AWS ACM?
- AWS ACM stands for AWS Certificate Manager.
- It is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that makes it easier for you to provision, manage, and deploy Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected resources.

### Key Features of AWS ACM:

1. **Provisioning SSL/TLS Certificates**:
   - AWS ACM allows you to easily provision SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services such as Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon API Gateway.

2. **Managed Renewals and Deployment**:
   - ACM manages the renewal of SSL/TLS certificates automatically, removing the need for manual intervention and ensuring certificates are always up to date.

3. **Integration with AWS Services**:
   - ACM integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, making it straightforward to deploy SSL/TLS certificates to resources like ELB, CloudFront distributions, and API Gateway APIs.

4. **Global Infrastructure and Scaling**:
   - ACM is designed to scale automatically and operates across multiple AWS regions, allowing you to use the same SSL/TLS certificate across your global infrastructure.

5. **Private Certificate Authority (CA)**:
   - ACM Private CA allows you to create and manage a private certificate authority, enabling you to issue private certificates for internal resources securely.

6. **Security and Compliance**:
   - ACM helps you maintain a secure environment by providing managed certificates that adhere to industry standards and best practices for encryption and security.

### Benefits of AWS ACM:

- **Simplified Management**: ACM automates the process of certificate management, reducing the complexity and operational overhead associated with SSL/TLS certificate deployment and renewal.

- **Cost-effective**: ACM provides SSL/TLS certificates at no additional cost beyond what you pay for the AWS resources using the certificates, making it cost-effective compared to third-party certificate authorities.

- **Integrated with AWS**: ACM integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, ensuring that SSL/TLS certificates are easily deployed and managed across your AWS infrastructure.

- **Highly Available and Secure**: ACM leverages AWS's global infrastructure and security best practices to ensure high availability and secure management of SSL/TLS certificates.
